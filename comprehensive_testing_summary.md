## Active Businesses Found (15 total)

| Slug | Business Name | Status |
|------|---------------|--------|
| ad31y | The DRIPBaR Direct - Sebring (FL) | ACTIVE |
| tc33l | Altura Health (TX) | ACTIVE |
| mj42f | (Unknown name) | ACTIVE |
| os27m | (Unknown name) | ACTIVE |

## Key Findings

### 1. Platform Architecture
- VSDHOne is a React Single Page Application (SPA)
- Serves identical HTML shell regardless of slug validity
- Business data loaded dynamically via JavaScript after page load
- HTTP requests cannot distinguish valid vs invalid slugs
- Browser automation required for accurate detection

### 2. Slug Distribution
- **Active businesses**: 15 (0.097% success rate)
- **Inactive accounts**: 1,900+ confirmed 401 errors
- **Pattern**: [0-9a-z]{5} - 5 character alphanumeric slugs
- **Total possible combinations**: 36^5 = 60,466,176

### 3. Business Types
- Primarily healthcare/wellness businesses
- Common services: Weight loss injections (Semaglutide, Tirzepatide), IV therapy
- Geographic distribution: Across multiple US states

### 4. Testing Efficiency
- Browser automation: ~0.06 slugs/second
- API testing: Much faster but inaccurate (false positives)
- Comprehensive scanning would take months at current rate

## Recommendations

### 1. Targeted Scanning
- Focus on specific patterns or ranges based on business naming conventions
- Consider geographic or business type clustering

### 2. Improved Detection
- Develop more sophisticated business indicators
- Look for specific HTML elements or JavaScript patterns unique to active businesses

### 3. Parallel Scaling
- Increase parallel instances for faster coverage
- Consider distributed scanning across multiple machines

### 4. Pattern Analysis
- Analyze existing active slugs for patterns
- Look for sequential or related slug assignments

## Files in Database

### Testing Method Categories
1. **Known_Working**: 15 slugs (original active businesses)
2. **API_HTTP_This_Laptop**: 100 slugs (all inactive)
3. **Browser_Automation_Early**: 5 slugs (validation tests)
4. **Browser_Automation_Comprehensive**: 1,500+ slugs (samples from 12,353 tested)
5. **Other_Laptop_Range_Testing**: 300 slugs (samples from 3,000+ tested)

### Status Distribution
- **ACTIVE**: 15 businesses
- **INACTIVE_401**: 1,900+ confirmed inactive accounts

## Next Steps
1. Continue comprehensive browser scanning with multiple parallel instances
2. Analyze patterns in active business slugs for optimization
3. Consider alternative discovery methods (social media, business directories)
4. Develop automated business information extraction for found active slugs
